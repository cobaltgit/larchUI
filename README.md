## features

- small install size
- focused selection of supported platforms - but not as narrow in scope as minui
- retroarch configs and custom shaders borrowed from spruce
- simple aesthetic and snappy interface
- automatically hide systems that you don't have roms for
- smart cpu control to reduce heat and improve battery life
- improved performance for N64 thanks to KMFDManic's LudicrousN64 core

## what does "larch" mean?

a larch is a coniferous tree of the genus _Larix_. unlike the closely related spruce family, larches are not evergreen, but rather, lose their needles in the fall. that said, the needles grow back in the spring, and these long-lived trees can grow almost 200 feet tall.
